title: "True Overconfidence: The Inability of Rational Information Processing to Account for Apparent Overconfidence"
collection: publications

excerpt: 'The better-than-average effect describes the tendency of people to perceive their skills and virtues as
being above average. We derive a new experimental paradigm to distinguish between two possible
explanations for the effect, namely rational information processing and overconfidence. Experiment par-
ticipants evaluate their relative position within the population by stating their complete belief distribu-
tion. This approach sidesteps recent methodology concerns associated with previous research. We find
that people hold beliefs about their abilities in different domains and tasks which are inconsistent with
rational information processing. Both on an aggregated and an individual level, they show considerable
overplacement. We conclude that overconfidence is not only apparent overconfidence but rather the con-
sequence of a psychological bias.'
