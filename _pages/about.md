I am an Associate Professor of Finance at Aarhus University's School of Business and Social Sciences, as well as a Research Fellow of the Danish Finance Institute (DFI). Prior to my current position, I held the role of Associate Professor at Kühne Logistics University in Hamburg for three years. My academic journey began at the University of Mannheim, where I completed my PhD and served as an Assistant Professor of Finance and Banking from 2012 to 2017. Even earlier, I studied Economics at the University of Cologne. I was a visiting scholar at Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, and Aalto University, Helsinki.

My research interests include Behavioral Finance, Household Finance, Experimental Economics, Sustainable Finance, and Digital Finance. Among other topics, I analyze how individual investors convert their beliefs and preferences into actions in financial markets. I have extensively studied phenomena such as investor overconfidence and loss aversion. I further analyze how financial professionals (in particular analysts) process information and form expectations. In newer work, I explore imminent societal challenges such as digitalization and demographic change. For example, I examine financial technology companies (FinTechs) and how they interact with their customers.

My current teaching includes courses on Corporate Valuation and Behavioral Finance. I have taught various courses at ALBA Graduate Business School Athens, KLU, University of Mannheim, University of Münster, University of Cologne, and for the VHB. I am an associate editor for the Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance.
