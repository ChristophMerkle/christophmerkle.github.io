I am an Associate Professor of Finance at Aarhus University's School of Business and Social Sciences and a Research Fellow at the Danish Finance Institute (DFI). Before joining Aarhus, I was an Associate Professor at Kühne Logistics University in Hamburg. I completed my PhD at the University of Mannheim, where I also served as an Assistant Professor of Finance and Banking from 2012 to 2017. I was a visiting scholar at Duke University, Fuqua School of Business, and Aalto University, Helsinki.

My research spans Behavioral Finance, Household Finance, Experimental Economics, Sustainable Finance, and Digital Finance. I focus on how individual investors and financial professionals translate beliefs and preferences into investment behavior—investigating topics such as overconfidence, loss aversion, and analysts’ information processing. Recently, I have turned to imminent societal challenges such as digitalization and demographic change. This includes examining financial technology companies (FinTechs) and their interactions with customers.

I currently teach courses on Corporate Valuation and Behavioral Finance. In addition to Aarhus, I have taught at ALBA Graduate Business School Athens, KLU, the University of Mannheim, the University of Münster, the University of Cologne, and for the VHB. I also serve as an Associate Editor of the Journal of Behavioral and Experimental Finance.
