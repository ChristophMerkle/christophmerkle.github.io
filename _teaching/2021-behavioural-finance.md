Next offered: Fall term 2024 (by Alexander Koch)

The course complements the introductory bachelor course in finance by adding a behavioural perspective. It rests on empirical evidence on how people actually make financial decisions. I cover the perspective of individual investors as well as consequences for financial markets. The course relates to and brings in relevant topics from related fields such as behavioural and experimental economics, and psychology.
